Bioclipse Software Development Kit
----------------------------------

This Git repository holds the plugins for Eclipse (not Bioclipse) to help people
development new plugins for Bioclipse.

Reading material
----------------

New Project Wizard:

* http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv/guide/jdt_api_wizards.htm

How to test the Plugin:

* http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Your%20First%20Plug-in/YourFirstPlugin.html (see Step 7)

* However that instruction seems to be for an old Eclipse verson. Basically
  what you do is (it's probably easiest to do this in a seperate workspace from
  your Bioclipse devlopment) open the Run configurations dialog and create a
  new Eclipse application run configuration. All settings should be correct
  from the beginning and when you run you should get a new Eclipse window with
  our plugin running.
